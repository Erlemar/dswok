Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, modeling the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. Common variations of Logistic regression: Binary (two possible outcomes), Multinomial (more than two unordered outcomes), Ordinal (more than two ordered outcomes).
Logistic regression is similar to [[Linear Regression]] but uses a logistic (sigmoid) function on the top of it.

$p(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$
where $z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ$

Logit function: $log(\frac{p}{(1-p)}) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ$

The logit is the logarithm of the odds. Logits transform probabilities (from 0 to 1) to real numbers. The sigmoid function is the inverse of the logit function. It maps any real number to a probability between 0 and 1.

Odds represent the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.
If p = 0.75, odds = $\frac{0.75}{1-0.75}$ = 3 - This means the event is 3 times more likely to occur than not to occur.

## Assumptions
1. Independence of observations
2. Little or no multicollinearity among independent variables
3. Linearity in the logit for continuous variables

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
Logistic regression parameters are typically estimated using MLE.

### Likelihood Function
$L(β) = ∏ᵢ p(xᵢ)^yᵢ * (1-p(xᵢ))^{1-yᵢ}$

### Log-Likelihood
$ll(β) = Σᵢ [yᵢ log(p(xᵢ)) + (1-yᵢ) log(1-p(xᵢ))]$

## Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

In practice, gradient descent is often used to find the optimal parameters.

Update rule: $β = β - α * ∇J(β)$
Where $α$ is the learning rate and $∇J(β)$ is the gradient of the cost function.

## Interpretation of Coefficients
- $βᵢ$: Log-odds increase for a one-unit increase in $xᵢ$, holding other variables constant
- $exp(βᵢ)$: Odds ratio for a one-unit increase in $xᵢ$. If $exp(β)$ = 1.2, a one-unit increase in $x$ multiplies the odds by 1.2 (20% increase).

## Advantages
- Simple and interpretable
- Provides probability outputs
- Less prone to overfitting compared to more complex models

## Limitations
- Assumes linearity in log-odds
- Cannot capture complex, non-linear relationships without feature engineering
