# Machine Learning and Data Science Knowledge Base

Welcome to my Obsidian notes on ML/DS. I have spent many years passively collecting knowledge in the form of text snippets and links and recently decided to go through all of it and structure it.
This obsidian vault will have notes about general ML theory, the approaches to specific business cases, interview preparations and other things.
For now it is quite sparse, but I plan to regularly update it.
