LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that allows to adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks while minimizing computational resources.

### Core Concept

While pre-trained models have large weight matrices, the rank of the update matrices (changes) during fine-tuning can be much lower. LoRA does the following:
1. Freezes the original pre-trained model weights
2. Injects trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into model layers
3. Represents weight updates as the product of these smaller matrices

Mathematically, instead of directly learning a weight update matrix $ΔW$ to add to the pre-trained weight matrix W, LoRA approximates this update using two smaller matrices: $ΔW = BA$
Where:
- A is a matrix of size r × d (r << d)
- B is a matrix of size d × r (r << d)
- r is the rank parameter (typically 4-256)

During inference, the effective weight matrix becomes: $W' = W + ΔW = W + BA$

LoRA is typically applied to selected weight matrices within transformer architectures:
- Most commonly applied to attention layers (query, key, value, and output projection)
- Can also be applied to feed-forward network layers
- Usually initialized with A using random Gaussian initialization and B with zeros

An additional scaling parameter α is used to control the magnitude of updates: $W' = W + α(BA)/r$

## Advantages
1. Parameter Efficiency: Reduces trainable parameters by up to 10,000 times compared to full fine-tuning for LLMs.
2. Memory Efficiency: Reduces GPU memory requirements by approximately 3 times compared to full fine-tuning.
3. No Inference Latency: LoRA matrices can be merged with the original weights after training, resulting in no additional latency during inference.
4. Comparable or Better Performance: Often performs on par with or better than full fine-tuning despite having fewer trainable parameters.
5. Task Switching: Makes it easier to switch between different tasks by swapping only the LoRA weights instead of entire model checkpoints.

## Key Hyperparameters
1. Rank (r): Controls the capacity of the adaptation. Higher ranks provide more flexibility but increase parameter count. Usual values are 4-256, but after 64 or 128 there are diminishing returns. For smaller models `r` can be lower, for larger models it should be large.
2. Alpha (α): Scaling factor for the LoRA updates. A good heuristic is to set alpha to twice the rank value.
3. Target Modules: Which layers of the model to apply LoRA to. Applying LoRA to more layers generally improves performance but increases memory usage. 
4. Dropout: Can be applied to LoRA matrices to prevent overfitting.
## Variants
1. QLoRA: Quantizes the base model to 4-bit precision to further reduce memory requirements.
2. Layer-wise Optimal Rank Adaptation: Assigns different ranks to different layers based on their importance.
3. AdaLoRA: Adaptively allocates parameter budget across layers.
4. VeRA: Vector-based Random Matrix Adaptation, where the low-rank decomposition uses random matrices.
